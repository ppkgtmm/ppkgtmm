# data

data can be categorized based on arrangement and format into

## structured data

- data is organized into tables with rows and columns
- each row is a record with fixed set of columns
- each column is an attribute or field with fixed data type

**:tada: use when** : data query and analysis are frequent or data integrity is non-negotiable

## semi-structured data

- data is organized in specific way e.g. key-value pair, document, graph, column family
- data records can have different set of fields
- field data types can vary between records

## unstructured data

- data is stored in its native format and requires organization
- each data item can have different set of information
- information format can vary between data items

**:tada: use when** : data format is unpredictable or storage and processing power is not a concern

remarks : data integrity is opposite of data corruption or data errors
