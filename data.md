# data

data can be categorized based on arrangement and format into

## structured data

- data is organized into tables with rows and columns
- each row is a record with fixed set of columns
- each column is an attribute or field with fixed data type

## semi-structured data

- data records can have different set of fields
- field data types can vary between records

## unstructured data

- data is stored in its native format and requires organization
- each data item can have different set of information
- information format can vary between data items

## comparison
