# Hello ðŸ‘‹

 </div>
 
- I'm Pinky, a data engineer in proptech where I create and maintain data pipelines to do ETL and ELT
- During my previous role as a backend developer, I got to prepare data for analysis and product recommendation
- There I knew the importance of data preparation in insights discovery and decision making resulting in transition to data engineering
