Hi there !

I'm Pinky Gautam currently a senior student at KMUTT 🙂 

Looking for software engineer, data engineer, data scientist job opportunities 😐

I'm an expat living in Thailand.

I've contributed to an npm validation library

During my first internship I've contributed for building a website that help brands find influencers to promote their products

Currently I'm trying to come up with deep learning models for sentiment analysis task.
