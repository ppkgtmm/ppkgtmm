## 🎀 Data Engineering
data is differentiated based on its arrangement and format into 3 categories namely structured, semi-structured and unstructured
| category | description | when to use |
| ---      | ---         | ---         |
| structured data | data is organized into tables with rows and columns. each row is a record with fixed set of columns. each column is an attribute or field with fixed data type | data is frequently queried and analyzed or data integrity is non-negotiable |
| semi-structured data | data is organized in specific way e.g. key-value pair, document, graph etc. records can have different set of fields and data type of fields can vary between records | record structure requires flexibility and storage overhead is a concern |
| unstructured data | data is stored in its native format and requires organization. each data item can have different set of information and information format can vary between data items | data format is unpredictable or storage and processing power is affordable |
