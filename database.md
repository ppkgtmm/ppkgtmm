# database

collection of information which are broadly categorized into

## relational database

- holds structured data in tabular model
- uses SQL as standard query language
- scales vertically by adding more resources to a single server
- include rules or constraints to ensure data integrity
- inherently supports relationship between records within or across tables

**:sparkles: use when** : data integrity and consistency is non negotiable or deferrable


## non-relational database

- holds semi-structured data in variety of models
- query language depends on database type
- scales horizontallyÂ by distributing data across multiple servers

**:sparkles: use when** : data format is unpredictable or availability is a concern
